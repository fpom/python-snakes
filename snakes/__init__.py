SNAKES is a Python library allowing to model all sorts of Petri nets
and to execute them. It is very general as most Petri nets annotations
can be arbitrary Python expressions while most values can be arbitrary
Python objects.

SNAKES can be further extended with plugins, several ones being
already provided, in particular two plugins implement the Petri nets
compositions defined for the Petri Box Calculus and its successors.
